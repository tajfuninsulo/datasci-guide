Descriptive analysis

It is analysis that is usually done at first. The goal of tha analysis is to describe set of data. The target is to descibe what you see and not to decide or predict what that means.

For example, it can be collecting of data on time series that could be later used.

Exploratory analysis

Find connections or relations in reasearch we did not know about.

Inferential analysis

Estimating both quantity and uncertainty about estimate. Depends on population and sample schema.

Predictive analysis

The goal is predict values of object from values from other objects. If X predicts Y, it does not mean that X is causing Y.

We need to measure right variables. For example, if I know what you have bought recently, I could predict you will have a baby.

Causal analysis

What will happen if you change value of one variable to other value.

Randomized studies might be required to identify causation.

Example: If you give people cure for cancer, they will live longer and goverment debt will increase.

Mechanistic analysis

Understand how a change of variable lead to changes of other variables of individual objects. Usually deterministic set of equations.
