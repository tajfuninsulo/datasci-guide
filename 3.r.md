# 3. R

[R language](http://www.r-project.org/) is implementation of [S language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_%28programming_language%29), implemented in New Zealand. It is that simple. So, if you know S then R will be really easy for you and it runs even on Play Station 3! If actually anyone cares.

R works in memory, so loading bigger data can be an issue. That is good to consider before using R for manipulating big data. But there is benefit, there is about 4000 packages you can use. For small data, of course.
