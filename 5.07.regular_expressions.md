# 5.07. Regular Expressions

In many cases, first we will have to develop a regular expression. We can use http://www.regexr.com to do that.

Lets say we created this regular expression ```want|develop``` that will find rows where there is "want" or "develop" words.

We can use regular expressions with ```grep```, ```grepl```, ```sub```, ```strsplit```, ```regexpr```, ```gregexpr``` and ```gsub``` functions.

### [grep](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/grep.html) function

    > text <- "We want to develop new regular expression."
    > grep("want|develop", text, value=TRUE)

    [1] "We want to develop new regular expression."
