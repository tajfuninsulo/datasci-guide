# 4.01. Files

Before we start working with files we need to set working directory using ```setwd()``` function. When we set working directory, all the files will be automatically stored there.

### Functions

Here is few functions that might be handy while working with files.

`getwd()` returns current working directory.

`setwd()` sets current working directory. For example `setwd("/Users/ondrej/R/examples")` will change working directory to ` "/Users/ondrej/R/examples"`.

`file.exists("raw-data.csv")` checks whether a file exists.

`dir.create("temp")` creates a new directory in working directory.

`download.file()` downloads file to working directory.

```
url <- "https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/dz54-2aru/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
download.file(url, destfile="./rows.csv", method="curl")
```

```list.files(".")``` lists files in working directory.

```readLines``` reads file into memory

```load``` will read binary data

```file.remove(...)``` removes a file
